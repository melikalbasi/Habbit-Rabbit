Habbit Rabbit helps you build better lifestyle habits, starting with diet and exercise.  By providing recipes based on your dietary preferences and exercise activites based on your capabilities, Habbit Rabbit allows you to have a menu of healthy choices at your fingertips, taking the guesswork out of what to cook tonight or what exercise to choose. The goal is to eliminate unhealthy last minute choices to get fast food or sit at home and watch TV. With this tool, you can start living your best life by forming good habits.

## Getting Started

Once you’re all signed up, go ahead and login! The app will welcome you by name! And give you a couple of options to choose from, recipes, activities, or favorites(coming back to this later).
